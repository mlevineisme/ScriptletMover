ScriptletMover
==============

**ScriptletMover** will take files in the directory it is placed within, and copy them to destinations listed in the ScriptletMover.conf file.

**This is especially helpful for some specific situations**
- Files need to be copied frequently
- Files need to be copied to multiple locations
- All locations files are copied to must be on the same file version
